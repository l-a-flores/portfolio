# Senior Software Engineer — Production Systems

I design, build, and maintain production systems used by real businesses.
My work focuses on logistics platforms, account-based commerce systems, and long-running operational software.

This portfolio highlights systems that are actively used, refactored, and evolved over time — not demos or tutorials.
